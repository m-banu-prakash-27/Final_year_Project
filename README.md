# Final_year_Project
The objective is to predict future university or college rankings and to design a Recommendation system that notifies institutions of which factors could be addressed to improve their future rankings.
Here the datasets used are from the NIRF (NATIONAL INSTITUTIONAL RANKING FRAMEWORK) website.
The ranks of university or college were predicted by using previous years' parameters in the model.
The machine learning models were built using machine learning algorithms like Ridge Regression, Decision Tree Regression, KNN Regression, Linear Regression, Lasso Regression and Random Forest Regression.
Later, a recommendation system was built which tells a university or college which parameters must be improved so as to get better rankings in the future.
